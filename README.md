# survey-form
A basic survey form that can be used and customized for any business

This was a small project I built for a freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design project. 
It encorporates responsive elements to create a survey form that can be utilized accross all devices.
The tools used are basic HTML5 and CSS3.
